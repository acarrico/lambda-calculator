lambda-calculator

A substitutional interpreter for the untyped call-by-name λ-calculus.

The interpreter keeps track of variable names and does full α-conversion, so it
can output many λ-terms that traditional functional interpreters cannot. For
example, in most Schemes, a partially-applied function would evaluate to an
unprintable value, represented in the REPL by a placeholder string like
#<procedure>. Instead, in λ-calculator, the abstract syntax tree is actually
un-parsed and printed, and the user sees the partially-applied function in the
same syntax that is used for input.

There is currently no REPL, so you must write your programs as strings and call
them like this:

(print (reduce (parse (tokenize (string->list "YOUR PROGRAM HERE")))))

Good luck!

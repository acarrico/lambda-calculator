lambda-calculator

A substitutional interpreter for the untyped call-by-name λ-calculus.

The interpreter keeps track of variable names and does full α-conversion, so it
can output many λ-terms that traditional functional interpreters cannot. For
example, in most Schemes, a partially-applied function would evaluate to an
unprintable value, represented in the REPL by a placeholder string like
#<procedure>. Instead, in λ-calculator, the abstract syntax tree is actually
un-parsed and printed, and the user sees the partially-applied function in the
same syntax that is used for input.

To use the interpreter, just run main.scm with your favorite R6RS
implementation, and pipe a λ-expression into standard input.

Good luck!
